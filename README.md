Final project of Multimedia Degree. I designed and developed with agile methodologies a mobility app for the public transport (bus) of Sant Cugat del Vall√®s. It was developed with Flutter using Visual Studio and data was fetched through HTTP requests.

On the main screen the user can watch the Bus Stops location in the map and if he taps a Bus Stop icon, it displays a sheet with bus stops information and next buses. Also, the user can geolocalize himself, display a navegation drawer and access to favorites bus stops screen.
